checkpkg - Compare the current build package with the repository version

Synopsis
--------
checkpkg

Description
-----------

This should be run from a directory containing a PKGBUILD. It searches for a
locally built package corresponding to the PKGBUILD, and downloads the last
version of that package from the Pacman repositories. It then compares the list
of .so files provided by each version of the package and outputs if there are
soname differences for the new package. A directory is also created using
mktemp with files containing a file list for both packages and a library list
for both packages.
